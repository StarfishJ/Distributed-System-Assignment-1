# Test Results and Analysis

This directory contains test results, performance analysis, and visualization charts.

## Files

- `throughput_over_time.csv` - Throughput data (10-second buckets) generated by Part 2 client
- `throughput_chart.png` - Line chart showing throughput over time (generated by Python script)
- `profile.html` - Performance profiling data (if available)

## Generating the Throughput Chart

### Step 1: Run Part 2 Client

The Part 2 client automatically exports throughput data to `results/throughput_over_time.csv`:

```bash
cd ../client/client_part2
mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="http://your-server:8080"
```

The CSV file will be created automatically in the `results/` directory with columns:
- `Time (seconds)` - Elapsed time since main phase started
- `Throughput (msg/s)` - Messages per second in that 10-second bucket

### Step 2: Generate Chart

Use the Python script to generate the line chart:

```bash
cd results
python generate_throughput_chart.py
```

Or specify a custom CSV file:

```bash
python generate_throughput_chart.py path/to/throughput_over_time.csv
```

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.x
- matplotlib: `pip install matplotlib`

The script will generate `throughput_chart.png` showing throughput over time with 10-second buckets.

## Chart Description

The line chart shows:
- **X-axis:** Time in seconds (10-second intervals)
- **Y-axis:** Throughput in messages per second
- **Data points:** Each point represents the average throughput during a 10-second period

This visualization helps identify:
- Throughput stability over time
- Performance degradation or improvement trends
- Peak throughput periods
- Any anomalies or spikes
